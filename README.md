# Caesar-Cipher

when Caesar wanted to send highly sensitive military messages,he would encode his message so that each letter would be shifted by apredetermined amount.
So let's say that we wanted to encode the letter "A" and we shift it by three,well then A becomes D, B becomes E and so on and so forth.
This is a simple program that will encrypt any message and decrypt it in caesar cipher.
